「Case for Support とは」
http://www.fundingcentral.org.uk/page.aspx?SP=6279

What’s a 'case for support' and why do we need one?

When applying for a grant, you will need to explain clearly and
concisely to a potential funder why you need funding and what you plan
to do with it.
なんでFundingが必要なのか!

Building and maintaining a 'case for support' is a central task for
any organisation seeking funding - as it underpins your fundraising
efforts.
Every application needs to be tailored to the specific funding
opportunity. However, preparing a ‘case for support’ with all the
key facts and figures about your organisation means that you already
have the core elements to form part of a letter of application or
application form.
