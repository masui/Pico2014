Currently, almost all the Web services force a user to
use a unique user-id and a long password for authentication.
Password-based authenticatin scheme worked fine when
only professional users used a small number of computer systems,
it is now almost the worst authentication scheme because of the following reasons.

<ul>
<li>Passwords can be easily copied by everybody
<li>Fast computers can try ...
 適切なパスワードを選ぶのが難しい
 覚えるのに苦労するにもかかわらず忘れてしまうのは簡単である
 機械的に解読されやすい
 Fast computers can crack the system by brute-force
 安全な運用が難しい
 コピーが簡単
 認証時に文字入力装置が必要
</ul>

Prof. Stajano and his group at Cambridge have been tackling the problem
for several years, and they &#147;Pico&#148;

<h2>3. Description about who will benefit from the research</h2>

<div style="margin-left:10pt">
All the computer users in the world will benefit from the result of our research.
We now cannot live without the Web and the Internet at present and in the near future, and
user authentication is one of the most important issues, since literally all the Web users are
suffering from current password-based authentication systems.
If we could smoothly convert this frustrating situation to an ideal one,
all the Web users, or almost all the people in the world, would benefit from out research result.
